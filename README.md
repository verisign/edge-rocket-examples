Overview
========

This repository contains a selection of example scripts which run on the Edge Rocket platform. Each script resides in its own subdirectory and contains a more detailed README file. Note that in the current version of Edge Rocket the only way to build an application using multiple scripts is to give each script its own endpoints. For an example of a single Edge Rocket application (service) which is composed of multiple scripts take a look at the edgepress project.
